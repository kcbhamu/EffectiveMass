# EffectiveMass
A simple Python script used to calculate effective masses of electron and hole on valence and conduction bands automatically.

## Version
EffectiveMass v1.01.2

## Python Version
Python 3.6 or later.

## Installation
1. Move EffectiveMass to a directory where you can reach.
2. Add EffectiveMass to $PATH variable in your system environment and chmod "EffectiveMass.py" script to make it executable. (Optional)
3. Open command (CMD, in Windows) or bash shell (in Linux) and type the command below. It would echo "EffectiveMass v1.01.2" (i.e. the version of EffectiveMass) if it is successfully installed.
```Bash
# Windows
python C:\\path\\to\\EffectiveMass.py --version
# Linux
EffectiveMass.py --version
``` 

## Command
```bash
python EffectiveMass.py -p "project_directory" [-s "xsd_file"] [-c "xcd_file"] [-h] [-v]
```
* This script would create a new file named "'project_name' Effective Mass.out" in the specified project directory, which contains the calculation results.
* Option "-p" (or "--project") is required to specify the project directory (i.e. "project_directory") which contains your calculated model file ("xsd_file") and band structure file ("xcd_file").
* Options "-s" ("--xsd") and "-c" ("--xcd") are used to specify the "xsd_file" and "xcd_file", which are not essential options if you didn't rename the project directory or files. The default names of "xsd_file" and "xcd_file" are "'project_name'.xsd" and "'project_name' Band Structure.xcd", respectively.
* Options "-h" ("--help") and "-v" ("--version") are used to view the help manuscript and check the version of EffectiveMass, respectively.

## Mechanism
The effective mass is calculated by![effective_mass](https://github.com/liujiacode/EffectiveMass/blob/master/figures/effective_mass.jpg).

## Attention
1. Currently only DMol3 and CASTEP codes in Materials Studio (MS) are supported.

2. Before running this script, you should calculate the band structure of a specified crystal model in MS first. The calculation directory (i.e. "project_directory") should be reachable and contains model file (i.e. "xsd_file", "'project_name'.xsd") and band structure file (i.e. "xcd_file", "'project_name' Band Structure.xcd", which could be generated by "Analysis - Band Structure" option).

3. Atom unit (a.u.) is used in this calculation, i.e. energy is in Ha (Hartree), effective mass is in me (free electron mass) and distance is in bohr. Don't worry about the conversion of unit, this script would do it automatically.

3. If the names of project directory or files have been changed, you should specify the file names manually in calculation by using "-s" and "-c" options.

4. Derivatives in this script is calculated simply without interpolation. So the results would be more accurate if **more band structure points (lower separations)** are calculated when performing **the DMol3 or CASTEP code (not this script)**. Also, you can calculate the derivatives by Origin or other softwares manually. The results calculated by Origin **might not** equal to the results calculated by this script because of different deriative-performing methods.
